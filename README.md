# simplified-contract-testing

Examples of a simplified and more easily achievable form of automated contract testing:

- rest-api/         An example of contract testing against an existing REST API.
- mocked-mongodb/   An example of contract testing a REST API with a mock database.
- mocked-rabbit/    An example of contract testing a REST API and asynchronous messaging with a mock RabbitMQ.

See README files in subdirectories to learn how to run each example.

You need Node.js installed to run these examples.
